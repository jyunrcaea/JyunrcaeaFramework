# Contribute this project

## Bug
you can create issue for you found bug by using my framework.

## Function
maybe, it's very difficult work.
if you want to contribute my framework by programming,
you should know C# and how to this framework work.
so, i can't recommand this way. just leave it to me.

or, other way is you create issue for create new function that you want to.
